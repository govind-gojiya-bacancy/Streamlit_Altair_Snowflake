# Snowflake

- 3 Layer : 
    - 1. Centralized Storage
    - 2. Multi-Cluster Compute and Processing
    - 3. Cloud Services

### Centralized Storage
- When data is loaded into Snowflake, it reorganizes that data into Snowflake’s 
  internal optimized, compressed, columnar format. Snowflake stores this optimized 
  data in cloud storage. Snowflake manages all aspects of how this data is stored.

### Query Processing
- Each virtual warehouse is an independent compute cluster that does not share 
  compute resources with other virtual warehouses. As a result, each virtual 
  warehouse has no impact on the performance of other virtual warehouses.

### Cloud Services
- The services within this layer include:
    - Authentication
    - Infrastructure management
    - Metadata management
    - Query parsing and optimization
    - Access control


# Snowflake python connector
- pip install snowflake-connector-python
- can use with Python to connect snowflake and perform DDLs, DMLs, and SQL.
- Query run inside Snowflake.
- SF Warehouse size limit can give advantage of parallel processing where it use processing/Cpu of Snowflake Eco System
- Problem : Fetching huge data from SF to Pandas DF will also cause resource contention due to huge data movement from SF to client system.

# SnowPark 
- pip install snowflake-snowpark-python
- process data in Snowflake without moving data to the system where your application code runs
- DF style of programming construct to developers with same performance as that of SQL queries .
- code push-down approach where all the code including Your favourite Python functions (UDFs) are 
  pushed to the server and runs natively in Snowflake’s Compute Engines giving You the best performance.

# Snowflake connector Vs Snowpark 

- So we learned Snowpark provides a DF style of programming construct where
  the application code is pushed to SF environment and run natively within 
  Snowflake and gives the same performance as We get by firing a SQL Query 
  to Snowflake.


- Basically Snowflake connector query result in table if we want to give to Pandas DF
  then it will take load on where script running where Snowpark DF give capability to 
  directly make Snowpark Df inside the snowflake enviroment. As we know snowflake support 
  many cluster that will give more power computation can lead to decrease in time to take data 
  in DF.
